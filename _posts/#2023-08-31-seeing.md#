by Pierre-Louis Pierson French. The mysterious and beautiful woman in the photograph is
     Countess Virginia Oldoini Verasis di Castiglione, the mistress of
     Napoleon III. Photo was taken around 1861–67, and printed
     ca. 1930. What is see seeing? What are we seeing when our gaze
     meets her eyes? Among hundreds of photos of her taken by the same
     photographer this one stands out. Why is this so? What is so
     special in this photo that makes it mysterious and appealing?<a

## Seeing is believing
	    
<p> So goes the saying. But what does it really mean? The implied
suggestion is that people tend to believe in things more readily when
they can directly see or experience them. It implies that firsthand
sensory perception provides a strong basis for knowledge and
belief. This is a fundamental aspect of empiricism. On the other hand
idealism suggests that while seeing is important it is not the only
factor in forming our beliefs. We will explore both views.



### Cognition
For the cognitive theories, phrase "seeing is believing" reflects the idea that human
perception plays a fundamental role in acquiring knowledge about the
world. Our sight provides us with immediate and tangible experiences
that form the foundation of our understanding and
actions. Cognitively, seeing something firsthand can lead to a more
concrete and vivid grasp of a concept or phenomenon. How does this
relate to images? Images in reality like a photograph? Or
phantasmogorical images in dreams?

### Art Theories
 Art theorists may argue that direct observation of an
artwork is crucial for understanding its intended meaning and artistic
expression. For example, John Berger in his <em>Ways of Seeing</em>
points that the mass production and dissemination of the classical
painting in form of books and posters has removed it from its context.
Hence the original meaning is multiplied.


### Religion and God

For most religious the image of god in the form of a visual
representation is equivalent to the god. This visual representation
can be in the form of a sculpture or a image. Some of the earliest
images made were of gods or of humans interacting with gods. This
reflects our inner desire to believe in something to create it and
once create to believe in it. Each reinforces another. Like the <em>
Drawing Hands</em> of M.C. Escher. But this is a generational
project. Passed on from parents to their children. Initiated into the
rituals and respect for the image and a representation of the divinity.



### Critical Graphicacy and Experts

They say experts can "see" the phenomenon in a graph. An expert in a
given field can relate to the images unlike a non-expert at another
level. They can go beyond and before of what is presented. They use
the image as a rhetoric device, interrogate it and extract evidences, inferences
and answers.

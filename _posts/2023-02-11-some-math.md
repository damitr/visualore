This is my first post with github pages using jekyll
Now to some maths
this should be an equation


\begin{equation}
E = mc^{2}
\end{equation}

Then there is an image

   ![stva](/physics/assets/figs/s-t-001.png)  
   
   now with more changes

where $E$ is the energy, $m$ is the mass and $c$ as usual is the velocity of light.

Whereas when 
we use

\begin{equation}
F = ma
\end{equation}

or then test the `physics` package from `latex`

so the physics test has failed, need to know where to add the physics package

## testing the physics package

$$
\dv{p}{t} = \pdv{\rho}{t}
$$

$$ \curl{\vb{B}} = ??$$

The temperature was $$ 90 \degree  $$ $$ 45 \celsius $$

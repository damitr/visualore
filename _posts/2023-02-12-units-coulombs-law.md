## Chapter 1 Electric Charges

### 1.11.1. What is the force of attraction between two unlike charges of $$\SI{1}{\micro\coulomb}$$ $$ \SI{1}{\micro\coulomb} $$ each placed at a distance of \SI{0.3}{\meter} from each other?

The force of attraction $$ F $$ between two charges is given by 
\begin{equation}
F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}
in this case, $$ q_{1} = q_{2} = 1 \, \mu C $$ and $$ r = \SI{0.3}{\meter} $$. Hence 
\begin{align}
F & = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{1 \, \mu \times 1 \, \mu \, C^{2}}{ (0.3 \, m)^{2}\, m^{2}} \\
& = \frac{9 \times 10^{9} \, N \, m^{2}/C^{2} \times 10^{-12} \, C^{2}} {9 \times 10^{-2} \, m^{2}} \\
& = 0.1 \, N
\end{align}


### 1.11.2. A pith ball suspended on a silk thread has a charge of $10 \, nC$. Another ball carrying the same charge is suspended at the same height at a certain distance from the first ball (Fig. 20). As a result of mutual repulsion, the balls diverge apart by $10\, cm$. By what angle are their threads declined from the vertical? The mass of each ball is $0.1\, g$. 

![Figure 20: To Exercise 1.11.2. To find the angle of threads from the vertical](/physics/assets/figs/landsberg/vol-2/ch-01/charge-repulsion.jpg)

Since the balls have the same charge they will repel each other with force given by Coulomb's law. This force will create the divergence in the balls from the vertical, that is, the total force on the balls will be equal to sum of gravitational force acting vertically downwards and electric force acting horizontally. Let us first calculate the repelling force between the two balls given by Coulomb's Law.

$$
F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$
in this case, $q_{1} = q_{2} = 1 \, nC$ and $r = 10 \, cm$. Hence 
\begin{align}
F & = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{10 \, \times 10 \, \, nC^{2}}{ (10 \, cm)^{2}\, m^{2}} \\
& = \frac{9 \times 10^{9} \, N \, m^{2}/C^{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-18} \, C^{2}} {100 \times 10^{-4} \, m^{2}} \\
& = 0.1 \, N
\end{align}



### 1.11.3. Two identical pith balls are suspended from the same hook and electrostatically charged. As a result, they are deflected from the vertical by an angle of ${5.7}^{\circ}$ \ang{5.7}. The length of the threads is  $1\, m$, the mass of each ball is $1\, g$. What is the charge on each ball? 

### 1.11.4. The charge of an electron is $1.60 \times 10^{-19}\, C$. Suppose that from each molecule of water contained in one litre an electron has been tom off and all the electrons are removed from the ions to a distance equal to that between the poles of the Earth, i.e. $12,800\, km$. What would be the force of attraction between these charges? Recall that the number of molecules in a mole of a substance is $6.02 \times 10^{23}$.

### 1.11.5. A hydrogen atom consists of a positive nucleus with one electron rotating around it. What must be the frequency of rotation of the electron around the nucleus so that it does not fall onto the nucleus if its orbit is a circle of radius $3 \times 10^{-10}\, m$? The electron mass is $0.91 \times 10^{-30}\, kg$.

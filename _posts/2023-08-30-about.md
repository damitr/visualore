## What is VisuaLore?
	    
<p>
    <span style="color:#aa0000ff;"> <b>visual: </b> </span> <i> relating to seeing or sight</i> </p>
<p>
    <span style="color:#aa0000ff;" > <b>lore: </b> </span> <i>a body of traditions and knowledge on a subject or held by a particular group, typically passed from person to person by word of mouth</i>
</p>

    <span style="color:#aa0000ff;" > <b>visual + lore = visualore: </b> </span> <i>a body of traditions and knowledge on graphics and visuals to help the viewers "see" the image and its meanings, held by a particular group, typically passed from person to person by word of mouth</i>
</p>

<p> VisuaLore is a space dedicated to pictures. Here we explore both
    meaning and meaning making with pictures. Pictures come in a
    variety of forms and are created in a variety of media. The oldest
    expressions of images made by humans are in the form of cave
    paintings found across the world. Ever since then we have
    progressed in our expressions and use of different media and
    instruments. We explore paintings, illustrations, sketches, maps,
    photographs, graphs and visualisations in VisuaLore. In short,
    VisuaLore is an exploration of graphics and meaning. It is an
    exploration into  <span style="color:#aa0000ff;" > <b>graphicacy
    </b> </span>.</p>
	
	
<p> In the digital age, most consumed images are on the electronic
    screens. Even images which are not originally made digitally are
    transformed into the digital media for our consumption and ease of
    access. Of course the images loose something when they are
    transformed to the digital, but they also gain something. </p>

<p> Sometimes we look at the inherent symmetries in the images, the
beauty of its form, its colour (or the lack of it). </p>
	
<p> Sometimes we look at the artists who created the images and their
history. Sometimes we will look at the impact some of the great images
have had on our culture. Sometimes we just admire the images. </p>

<p> We also look at how we understand and cognise the content of the
images. Sometimes we look at techniques, and inspiration, while at
other times we look at devices and instruments that made it
possible.</p>

<p> In short, there is no fixed theme at VisuaLore. Except for the
central idea of exploring and appreaciating images and visual
cognition.</p>

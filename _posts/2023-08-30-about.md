## What is VisuaLore?
	    
<p>
    <span style="color:#aa0000ff;"> <b>visual: </b> </span> <i> relating to seeing or sight</i> </p>

    <span style="color:#aa0000ff;" > <b>visual + lore = visualore: </b> </span> <i>a body of traditions and knowledge on graphics and visuals to help the viewers "see" the image and its meanings, held by a particular group, typically passed from person to person by word of mouth</i>
</p>

<p> VisuaLore is a space dedicated to pictures. Here we explore both
    meaning and meaning making with pictures. Pictures come in a
    variety of forms and are created in a variety of media. The oldest
    expressions of images made by humans are in the form of cave
    paintings found across the world. Ever since then we have
    progressed in our expressions and use of different media and
    instruments. We explore paintings, illustrations, sketches, maps,
    photographs, graphs and visualisations in VisuaLore. In short,
    VisuaLore is an exploration of graphics and meaning. It is an
    exploration into  <span style="color:#aa0000ff;" > <b>graphicacy
    </b> </span>.</p>
	
	
<p> In the digital age, most consumed images are on the electronic
    screens. Even images which are not originally made digitally are
    transformed into the digital media for our consumption and ease of
    access. Of course the images loose something when they are
    transformed to the digital, but they also gain something. </p>

<p> Sometimes we look at the inherent symmetries in the images, the
beauty of its form, its colour (or the lack of it). </p>
	
<p> Sometimes we look at the artists who created the images and their
history. Sometimes we will look at the impact some of the great images
have had on our culture. Sometimes we just admire the images. </p>

<p> We also look at how we understand and cognise the content of the
images. Sometimes we look at techniques, and inspiration, while at
other times we look at devices and instruments that made it
possible.</p>


<p> In short, there is no fixed theme at VisuaLore. Except for the
central idea of exploring and appreaciating images and visual
cognition.</p>

### A personal reason

<p> Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by images and visuals. My imagination went wild when thinking about images I saw. I would construct elaborate stories full of heroes, villains, places. All the paintings, artwork and magazines in my home helped in this. As I grew this fascination with visuals only increased. The incredible impact that images can have on one's understanding and thought processes was clear. During the early 2000s when I got my access to the Internet, I would browse through sites which hosted collections of artists images. Most of them were fantasy artists such as the great Louis Royo and Boris Vallejio. Added to that were the photographs. Earlier one's exposure to images was limited to the print and television one had access to. But with the internet suddenly there was a possibility of you to see *any* image that was created. This changed everything. </p>



<p> As a part of my PhD I did research on how children learn to draw graphs and inferences from them. This specific process of meaning making from the visuals, is not isolated. The research on graphs helped me understand the wider aspects of visual cognition. And this all fell in line with what I had experienced till now, looking at the images. 

<p> I got my digital camera a Canon S2 in 2005. It changed how you took photos. You could preview the photo and take several shots. Taking thousands of photos. Experiencing the "Aha" moments, when you know the photo has just come out as you had visualised it and intended it. I have also used, at times, several of my own photographs which I have liked.</p>

<p> Sometimes the meanings are implied and universally understood. You don't need art experts to decipher it for you. The image speaks to you as if it were a friend, sometimes a mysterious stranger enticing you with its charms. </p>

<p> So this project is my personal journal of the images that I have found to be fascinating, inspiring, seductive and emotionally evocative. Some images have remained in my long-term memory ever since I saw them. There seems to be an internal beauty which resonates with the aesthetic algorithm in my mind.</p>

<p>Thus this collection of seemingly unrelated images is based on what I have liked over the years. As I continue to add images to this project, I hope to create a mosaic of memories that not only reflects my personal beliefs and thoughts but also evokes same response in the viewers of the project who happen to chance on this. This is an attempt to document the images, which would be otherwise lost in the endless wilderness of visuals. This would be a unending quest and a life-long project. But one which is worth doing in one's life time.</p>

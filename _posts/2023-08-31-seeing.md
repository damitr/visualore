     Pierre-Louis Pierson French. The mysterious and beautiful woman
     in the photograph is Countess Virginia Oldoini Verasis di
     Castiglione, the mistress of Napoleon III. Photo was taken around 1861–67, and printed
     ca. 1930. What is see seeing? What are we seeing when our gaze
     meets her eyes? Among hundreds of photos of her taken by the same
     photographer this one stands out. Why is this so? What is so
     special in this photo that makes it mysterious and appealing? <a

<h2>Seeing is believing </h2>
	    
<p> So goes the saying. But what does it really mean? The implied
suggestion is that people tend to believe in things more readily when
they can directly see or experience them. It implies that firsthand
sensory perception provides a strong basis for knowledge and
belief. This is a fundamental aspect of empiricism. On the other hand
idealism suggests that while seeing is important it is not the only
factor in forming our beliefs. We will explore both views.</p>

<h2>Cognition </h2>

<p>For the cognitive theories, phrase "seeing is believing" reflects the idea that human
perception plays a fundamental role in acquiring knowledge about the world. Our sight provides us with immediate and tangible experiences that form the foundation of our understanding and actions. Cognitively, seeing something firsthand can lead to a more concrete and vivid grasp of a concept or phenomenon. How does this relate to images? Images in reality like a photograph? Or phantasmogorical images in dreams? </p>

<h2>Art Theories </h2>

<p>Art theorists may argue that direct observation of an
artwork is crucial for understanding its intended meaning and artistic
expression. For example, John Berger in his <em>Ways of Seeing</em>
points that the mass production and dissemination of the classical
painting in form of books and posters has removed it from its context.
Hence the original meaning is multiplied.</p>

     Dürer's Melencolia I is one of three large prints of 1513 and
     1514 known as his Meisterstiche (master engravings).  Melencolia
     I is a depiction of the intellectual situation of the artist and
     is thus, by extension, a spiritual self-portrait of Dürer. What
     images make you sad? How does it work on your mind? <a

<h2> Emotions </h2>

<p>Visual images also invoke very strong emotions in us. Depending on the
type of image and its context, the full spectrum of human emotions can
be manifest on the interaction of the visual and the mental. Joy and
sorrow. Exuberence and depression. Lust and aversion. Empathy and
anger. There is a primal nature involved when looking at images fires
these emotions. But how do images interact with the hormones which drive
our emotions? The visual cognition fires some patterns in our brains
which in turn releases hormones in our lymbic system which cause us to
have these emotions. But this is a terse scientific explanation, does
it explain the feelings of lust when we see an erotic nude? </p>

<h2>Religion and God </h2>

<p>For most religious the image of god in the form of a visual
representation is equivalent to the god. This visual representation
can be in the form of a sculpture or a image. Some of the earliest
images made were of gods or of humans interacting with gods. This
reflects our inner desire to believe in something to create it and
once create to believe in it. Each reinforces another. Like the <em>
Drawing Hands</em> of M.C. Escher. But this is a generational
project. Passed on from parents to their children. Initiated into the
rituals and respect for the image and a representation of the
divinity.</p>

	 horizontal format of this sacred text is derived from the earlier
	 use of palm leaves instead of paper. This page is from the
	 foundational work of scripture for worshippers of the great
	 goddess Devi. The page is also the story in a multimodal
	 format. The words and the image. The image helps us visualise the
	 <em>devi</em> who has taken this <em>avatar</em> to slay the
	 demon. Notice her ride, a lion, and her choice of weapons. While
	 the demon is using a mountain as a weapon to crush the
	 devi. Relgious imagery is as powerful as it gets with images. The
	 reverence to the symbols that we show is unmatched to any other
	 use of images.

<h2>Nature </h2>

<p>A lot of images that we see are made of nature and its various
aspects. Ever since humans started to document natural things, we also
created images of them in media that were available to us. A large
part of this project is related to images of nature. When we create
these images, we make an abstraction. Does it represent the actual
reality? Or only an aspect of it? Can everything in natural world be
captured in the form of images? What role did images play in our
understanding of the natural world? </p>

<h2> Critical Graphicacy and Experts </h2>

<p>They say experts can "see" the phenomenon in a graph. An expert in a
given field can relate to the images unlike a non-expert at another
level. They can go beyond and before of what is presented. They use
the image as a rhetoric device, interrogate it and extract evidences, inferences
and answers.</p>

     in the photograph is Countess Virginia Oldoini Verasis di
     Castiglione, the mistress of Napoleon III. Photo was taken around 1861–67, and printed
     ca. 1930. What is see seeing? What are we seeing when our gaze
     meets her eyes? Among hundreds of photos of her taken by the same
     photographer this one stands out. Why is this so? What is so
     special in this photo that makes it mysterious and appealing? <a

<p> So goes the saying. But what does it really mean? The implied
suggestion is that people tend to believe in things more readily when
they can directly see or experience them. It implies that firsthand
sensory perception provides a strong basis for knowledge and
belief. This is a fundamental aspect of empiricism. On the other hand
idealism suggests that while seeing is important it is not the only
factor in forming our beliefs. We will explore both views.</p>



<h2>Cognition </h2>

<p>For the cognitive theories, phrase ''seeing is believing'' reflects the idea that human
perception plays a fundamental role in acquiring knowledge about the
world. Our sight provides us with immediate and tangible experiences
that form the foundation of our understanding and
actions. Cognitively, seeing something firsthand can lead to a more
concrete and vivid grasp of a concept or phenomenon. How does this
relate to images? Images in reality like a photograph? Or
phantasmogorical images in dreams? In interpreting the image, we
interpret ourselves.</p>

<h2>Imagination and Dreams </h2>
   <p>Our mind imagines and we try to visualise. But are the two
   different? Only when we bring it out in the real world from the
   mental realm. We imagine gods. Then we create icons of god in the
   form of images. Some are symbolic, some are anthropomorphic, some
   of are animalistic. Then we revere gods thus we created. Our dreams
   show us things which don't exist in reality, so do our images.</p>

A cavity in the torso is populated by three naked persons at a table, seated on an animal, and a fully clothed woman pouring drink from a barrel. How did Bosch come up with such creatures and scenes? What was the imagination is behind this image? How can we create images which have no connection to reality? Do such images drive our imagination in turn of what hell would be like? </span>

 <p> Image comes with story, sometimes it is part of the story,
 sometimes it is the story, sometimes it makes the story. Images help,
 you the reader, imagine and visualise what is happening in the
 story. Some stories are without images. Alice asks us ''and what is
 the use of a book, without pictures or conversations?'' then we
 construct images in our mind by conversing with the story, its
 characters, their thoughts, and the places they inhabit.</p>

<p> Nothing can travel faster than light, but our imagination can
	 travel millions of lightyears in a fraction of second, when we
	 visualise that photo of galaxies in the deepest reaches of space
	 we can see. What about the surrealist and bordering to absurd
	 geometries of space itself imagined by M. C. Eshcher? Perhaps
	 they exist as mathematical objects in some abstract space which
	 we cannot experience, yet some of us have imaginations that allow
	 to draw it?</p>
	 



<h2> Emotions </h2>

     I is a depiction of the intellectual situation of the artist and
     is thus, by extension, a spiritual self-portrait of Dürer. What

<p>Visual images also invoke very strong emotions in us. Depending on the
type of image and its context, the full spectrum of human emotions can
be manifest on the interaction of the visual and the mental. Joy and
sorrow. Exuberence and depression. Lust and aversion. Empathy and
anger. There is a primal nature involved when looking at images fires
these emotions. But how do images interact with the hormones which drive
our emotions? The visual cognition fires some patterns in our brains
which in turn releases hormones in our lymbic system which cause us to
have these emotions. But this is a terse scientific explanation, does
it explain the feelings of lust when we see an erotic nude? </p>


<h2>Religion and God </h2>

	 horizontal format of this sacred text is derived from the earlier
	 use of palm leaves instead of paper. This page is from the
	 foundational work of scripture for worshippers of the great
	 goddess Devi. The page is also the story in a multimodal
	 format. The words and the image. The image helps us visualise the
	 <em>devi</em> who has taken this <em>avatar</em> to slay the
	 demon. Notice her ride, a lion, and her choice of weapons. While
	 the demon is using a mountain as a weapon to crush the
	 devi. Relgious imagery is as powerful as it gets with images. The
	 reverence to the symbols that we show is unmatched to any other
	 use of images.

<p>For most religious the image of god in the form of a visual
representation is equivalent to the god. This visual representation
can be in the form of a sculpture or a image. Some of the earliest
images made were of gods or of humans interacting with gods. This
reflects our inner desire to believe in something to create it and
once create to believe in it. Each reinforces another. Like the <em>
Drawing Hands</em> of M.C. Escher. But this is a generational
project. Passed on from parents to their children. Initiated into the
rituals and respect for the image and a representation of the
divinity. In all religions a lot of human effort and resources have
been put to create the images of gods and godesses. </p>

<p> In the Indian context the concept of <em>darshan</em> embodies the
importance of visuals in Hindu religion. A darshan by its very nature
is a momentary glimpse at the deity placed in a temple. Though applied
to holy men and women, the primary mover is to visit the temple to
take the darshan. Even now, as they been doing for thousands of years,
devotees travel for many days, sometimes on barefoot, to go to the
holy sites, to get the darshan. The <em>darshan</em> or ''seeing'' of
the image of the god in the form of the idol is equivalent to seeing
the god himself. In this case, the phrase ''Seeing is believing'' is
literally true as is the case with other religions.

 



<h2>Nature </h2>

 Cave 1, ceiling.  A  cave painting from Ajanta in India. The Ajanta
 caves have some of the most beautiful paintings in the world. The
 depiction of nature plants, animals and other objects is a common
 theme across civilization. But how do we recognise that this is an
 elephant? What was the painter thinking when she decided to paint the
 elephant? Was it from her imagination? Has anyone seen a elephant
 playing in a lotus pond? Does this signify anything? And what about
 the lotus? Do any of the actual lotuses look like this? Or this an
 abstract representation of the Lotus?

<p>To create an image is to imitate from the latin <em>imago</em>. The
earliest visual images produced by humans imitated nature. We drew
animals, plants, ourselves, the moon and the sun and the stars. We
imagine and we represent what we see. Images lead to and come from our
imagination. We created these images of nature in media that were available to us. A large
part of VisuaLore is related to images of nature. When we create
these images, we make an abstraction. Does it represent the actual
reality? We often impicitly assume the image of the thing for the
thing itself. As Rene Magritte would know and ask us this tricky
question in <em> The Treachery of Images</em> by writing under the
paiting of the pipe that "This is not a pipe!". Or only an aspect of it? Can everything in natural world be
captured in the form of images? What role did images play in our
understanding of the natural world? </p>

<h2> Science </h2>

     class="marginnote">The telescope and the microscope take us to
     different scales of the universe. One takes us till the heart of
     matter itself, while the other takes us to largest structures
     that we have so far found. The telescope and the microscope by
     themselves made science advance by leaps and bounds, but when a
     camera was placed instead of the human eye, there was a
     qualitative change in the nature of images (and hence the data)
     they could produce. But we also need to ask when we are seeing
     the universe is it looking back at us. When we are looking at the
     universe at different scales, both ultra-small and ultra-large,
     is this the way of the universe looking at itself?</span>

<p> Science relies heavily on images. Looking at history of science we
see that images and visual metaphors were a driving force in the
development of science. With the advent of the telescope and the
micrscope and the camera and the resulting images and data and graphs
science progressed leaps and bounds. The scientific proof often
involves a photograph of the phenomenon or a graph depicting the
novelty in an abstract space.</p>

     (yellow and blue points with error bars), and a predicted one
     from distribution of the visible matter (gray line). This is a
     composite image which combines the optical photograph and
     velocities as measured from the spectrographic
     observations. These velocities are then plotted as a function of
     distance from the centre of the galaxy. The
     discrepancy between the two curves can be accounted for by adding
     a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy. Graphs such as these
     create a representation of the phenomenon from the data in an
     abstract space. The interpretation in this case results from the
     contextual accumulated knowledge of the physical systems applied
     to particular cases. Such discoveries would be impossible without
     a graphical device such as the graph.<a

 </figure>

<p>They say experts can "see" the phenomenon in a graph. An expert in a
given field can relate to the images unlike a non-expert at another
level. An example is the discovery of dark matter as shown in the
so-called galactic rotation curves. The graphs can go beyond and
before of what is presented. The graphs and other images as used as
rhetoric devices, interrogated and evidence inferences
and answers extracted from them. The image in this context is also a persuasion
device. Similarly, graphs are used to certify that something is
scientific and hence valid and true. Policy decisions affecting all of
us are made based on compelling inferences drawn from graphs. Graphs
depicting data which are ubiquitous now, came in at the end of 18th
and beginnign of 20th centuries by William Playfair. After that graphs
never went out of fashion. <\p>

The marketing advertisements are attestation of the persuasive
power of the visual images. The advertising images seduce and convince
the customers that happiness would be bestowed on them if they buy the
product. The huge billboards that are integral part of any city's
landscape are a testimony to this as are the pleothra of advertisement
in both print and digital media which blast at you.

The advertisers used Freud's analysis to design strategies
for selling more. For example, to increase the sale of the cigarretes
among women,the cigarrette was shown as a phallic object following Freud's concept
of penis envy. For details see the BBC documentary <em> The Century of Self</em>.
